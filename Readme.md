## How to create a boilerplate

It's very eazy to create a boilerplate, actually any Git repository can be a boilerplate, because the core process of this tool is "cloning the boilerplate repository".

You only need to prepare a boilerplate repository with the content you want, then you can quickly create it by `super-create` command.

**Tips: `super-create` only support the boilerplate which created by `npm` or other similar tool, other technology stacks are not supported.**
